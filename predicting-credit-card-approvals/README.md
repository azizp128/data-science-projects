# Project Description
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this workbook, you will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like real banks do.

# Dataset
The data is a small subset of the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository showing the credit card applications a bank receives.
- [Credit Approval](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/27/credit+approval)

# Task
- Preproccess the data and apply supervised learning techniques to find the best model and parameters for the job.
- Aim for an accuracy score of at least 0.75.

# Solution
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/azizp128/data-science-projects/blob/main/predicting-credit-card-approvals/notebook.ipynb)
