# Project Description
Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.

Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. 

You have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.

You have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.

> [!NOTE]  
> The project inspiration comes from DataCampâ€™s [Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/projects/exploring_nyc_public_school_test_result_scores/) project, which served as the foundation for this work.
